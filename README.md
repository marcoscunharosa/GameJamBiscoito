# GameJamBiscoito
 
 This game is called 'The Biscoiteiro'. You are an famous character of social media that is a really shown off, or most known as "Biscoiteiro". Your goal is to create the biggest horde of followers that are despered to give you some cookies.
 But be careful! There are two things that you have to avoid!
 - Destroy the data group that reports you (evangelical, happy moms or anti-biscoito groups)! If you do so, you can take off a piece of your clothes and more followers will appear along the way! If you don't destroy them, they will report you and you will be oficially baned!
 - Don't let your followers falls from the data that you in, and neither let them touch the bugs! You will lose followers in that way!

 If you get naked you gain a SUPER BOOST! But watch out for Mark Zuckerberg! If you find him while you naked, you lose your account immediately!
